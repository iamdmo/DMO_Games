DMO_Games
=========

These are the intiial forays into DMO Games.
Here I will be helping my 5 year old son learn to develop games using all of the historical and current languages.
My hope is that a basic understanding of computing will embolden him to learn and exlore the world around him with confidence that all things can (and are) made by humans. 
To make a world worth living in.
